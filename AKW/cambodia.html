            <h1>History of Cambodia</h1>
            <img src="img/Cambodia.png" alt="Cambodia" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: 20px auto;">
        <p>Cambodia has a rich and complex history that dates back thousands of years. It was home to the powerful Khmer Empire, which reached its peak between the 9th and 15th centuries. The empire is best known for its impressive temple complexes, including Angkor Wat, one of the largest religious monuments in the world. The influence of the Khmer Empire extended over much of Southeast Asia, and its legacy is still evident in the region today.

        </p>
        <p>After the decline of the Khmer Empire, Cambodia experienced periods of foreign domination and internal strife. In the 19th century, it became a protectorate of France and was later drawn into the Vietnam War. The country endured the brutal regime of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s, during which millions of people lost their lives. Since the 1990s, Cambodia has made significant progress in rebuilding and modernizing, though it still faces challenges in terms of economic development and human rights.
